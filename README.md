Cycles game

This is a two player game similar to slither.io. Two cycles controlled by the wasd and ijkl keys respectively drive around the screen trying to pick up more energy. As they do, their trail behind them grows by a random amount. The two players try to move their cycles to pick up the energy without running into their own trail or the other cycle's. If a player runs into themself or the other player, that player loses the game.
